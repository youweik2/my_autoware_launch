  ros__parameters:
    dynamic_obstacle_stop: # module to stop or before entering the immediate path of a moving object
      extra_object_width: 1.0  # [m] extra width around detected objects
      minimum_object_velocity: 0.5  # [m/s] objects with a velocity bellow this value are ignored
      stop_distance_buffer: 0.5  # [m] extra distance to add between the stop point and the collision point
      time_horizon: 5.0  # [s] time horizon used for collision checks
      hysteresis: 1.0  # [m] once a collision has been detected, this hysteresis is used on the collision detection
      add_stop_duration_buffer : 0.5  # [s] duration where a collision must be continuously detected before a stop decision is added
      remove_stop_duration_buffer : 1.0  # [s] duration between no collision being detected and the stop decision being remove
      minimum_object_distance_from_ego_trajectory: 1.0  # [m] minimum distance between the footprints of ego and an object to consider for collision
      ignore_unavoidable_collisions : true  # if true, ignore collisions that cannot be avoided by stopping (assuming the obstacle continues going straight)
